/**
 What the UI reads.

 One observable object shared by the status item, the popover and the settings
 window, so the three can never disagree about the state of the board. Everything
 here is display state derived from the registry — the registry itself is owned by
 the session store and rebuilt from hooks.

 Deliberately holds no device handle: the UI must keep rendering, and keep saying
 *why*, when the pad is unreachable.
