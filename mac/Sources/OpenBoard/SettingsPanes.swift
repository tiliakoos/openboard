 Device — connection, permissions, calibration, and what is deliberately inert.

 The permissions section is the important one. Several families, granted separately and
 independently — Input Monitoring and Bluetooth are both "talking to the pad" and having
 one says nothing about the other. Each produces a differently-shaped silent failure,
 and the app cannot fix any of them, so the least it can do is say precisely which is
 missing and open the right pane.

 each takes effect after OpenBoard restarts" earns its place; "Permissions — the
 permissions OpenBoard needs" would not.

 The subtitle stays optional in the type rather than required, so a section that
 genuinely has nothing to add is not forced to invent something.
