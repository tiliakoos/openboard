/**
 Fun mode's transport: play the video full-screen and drive the pad in time with it.

 ## Closed loop, not a timer

 Sync is measured against QuickTime's own playhead rather than run open-loop from a
 start timestamp. Over four minutes an open-loop timer drifts badly — and worse, it
 cannot tell that the video was paused, scrubbed or quit, so the lights would carry on
 dancing to nothing.

 ## This deliberately takes over the board

 Live agent status is overridden for the duration. It is a party trick, it was asked
 for, and the board is repainted when it ends.

     Sample the playhead and estimate *when* that value was true.

     A read costs ~100ms round-trip, so timestamping it on return biases the clock.
     Taking several samples and keeping the fastest reduces jitter, and crediting the
     sample to the midpoint of its own round-trip removes most of the remaining
     systematic error. What is left is a constant, which is what `leadMs` absorbs.
