/**
 One answer to "is this install finished", shared by everything that asks.

 Three surfaces need it — the popover decides whether to show the board at all, the
 settings panes decide whether they can mean anything, and the setup window is the list
 itself. Each of them probing independently would be three chances to disagree, and the
 one that disagreed would be the one showing a board that cannot paint or a colour
 picker that saves into the void.

 Refreshed on demand rather than polled. Every input changes outside this app — TCC in
 System Settings, hooks in a file, calibration in a sheet — so there is no event to
 subscribe to, and a timer would mean the answer is stale for exactly as long as someone
 is standing in System Settings waiting for it to notice.

     Whether the answer can be trusted yet.

     Not the same as "not set up", and conflating them is what made a finished install
     flash the welcome screen on launch. System Events is a launch-on-demand helper that
     macOS stops when idle, so at startup it usually reads `unavailable` — "cannot tell"
     — which is not a grant, so `isReady` was false, so every surface confidently showed
     the get-started UI. A moment later the wake finished, the real answer arrived, and
     it all vanished.

     The flash was brief, and that is the problem: too fast to read, long enough to
     suggest the app had forgotten something.

     The user chose to use the app without finishing setup.

     Skipping silences the gates — the popover shows sessions, the panes show their
     controls — without pretending anything is done: the checklist still shows what is
     missing, and the keys still stay dark until the install can actually paint. The
     alternative was a wall between the user and six sessions the app had already
     found, on the say-so of steps they had decided not to take yet.

     Cleared by finishing setup rather than by any UI: once `isReady` is true the flag
     is never consulted again.

     genuinely fresh install — including this. A UserDefaults key would survive the
     scratch directory and quietly make the rehearsal untestable in exactly the place it
