/**
 Guided setup — the four things that have to be true before anything lights.

 A checklist rather than a wizard, and that is forced by the platform: granting Input
 Monitoring only takes effect after OpenBoard restarts, so a linear flow would be killed
 by its own first step. This recomputes from the world every time it appears, which
 means quitting halfway and coming back lands where you left off.

 The pad itself is not in the list. Pairing and Layer 1 are things done on the hardware,
 neither is detectable from here, and an unticked box for something that is probably
 fine is worse than a sentence. They are stated at the bottom instead.
