/**
 Colors — everything the pad emits, on one pane.

 This was two tabs, Keys & Colors and Fun, and the split did not survive the question
 "which one holds the ring?". The ring is a color the board shows; so are the laps that
 fire on it, the toy shows, and the countdown. They were filed under Fun because they
 are animated, which is a fact about *how* they light rather than about what they are.

 These are **hardware** colors: the swatch and the LED are the same number. So the
 editor offers the real ones as presets and any hex besides, but no system color picker,
 whose output would be a screen color that happens to be nearby.

 ## Less scrolling, same controls

 Each state used to be a block about 110pt tall — swatch, ten presets, a hex field, an
 effect picker, two sliders — and seven of those meant most of a screen of scrolling
 before reaching anything else. Now a state is one row, and the color controls sit in a
 popover behind its swatch. Nothing was dropped: presets, hex, speed and the hardware
 preview are all still there, one click further in, which is the right distance for
 values that are set once and then left.

 Ordered by how often a thing is touched rather than by how it is implemented: colors,
 how long they stay, the ring, then fun mode.
