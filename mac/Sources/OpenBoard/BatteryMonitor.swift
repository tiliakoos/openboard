/**
 The pad's battery.

 ## Where it actually lives

 Not in the HID descriptors, not in the IO registry, not in `system_profiler`, not in
 the vendor RPC, and not in `IOBluetoothDevice`'s battery properties — all of which
 were checked, and all of which say nothing. The full 28MB registry dump contains no
 battery value anywhere near this device.

 It is published where every BLE device publishes it: the standard **GATT Battery
 Service**, `0x180F`, characteristic `0x2A19`. macOS reads it there for the Bluetooth
 menu, and `retrieveConnectedPeripherals(withServices:)` gives the same access — public
 API, no entitlement, no pairing, and no private framework.

 The lesson is the one this project keeps relearning: five confident negatives, and the
 answer was in the sixth place, which happened to be the standard one.

 ## Why it is polled slowly

 Reading means connect, discover, read — a few hundred milliseconds and some radio
 traffic on a device whose job is to respond to keypresses. Battery moves by single
 digits over hours, so a slow poll costs nothing and a fast one would be pure
 interference. It also refreshes when the popover opens, which is the only moment the
 number is actually being looked at.

         Pairing a Codex Micro twice leaves both registrations behind — this machine
         carries "Codex Micro #1" and "Codex Micro #3" — and a household with two pads
         is the ordinary version of the same thing. `first` then reports an arbitrary
         one's battery as though it were yours, which is the specific kind of
         confidently-wrong number this app exists not to show.

         Prefer one that is actually connected. If that still leaves a choice there is
         no way to tell them apart from here — the peripheral identifier is a per-host
         UUID, not the Bluetooth address the HID layer knows — so it reads the first and
         says so in the log rather than pretending the question did not come up.
