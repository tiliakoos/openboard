/**
 What is in front of you, in terms a session can be matched against.

 Two surfaces, two handles, and neither is interchangeable with the other: a Terminal tab
 is identified by its tty, a VS Code window by its title. Keeping them as separate cases
 rather than flattening both to a string is what stops a tty being compared against a
 window title and matching nothing for reasons nobody can see.

/**
 Which session you are actually looking at.

 `viewing` is idle-with-your-attention-on-it. Without it, the chat in front of you looks
 exactly like the five you are not reading, and the board answers "what is running?"
 without ever answering "and which of these am I in?".

 ## Why this is not a 4Hz poll

 The Node version ran a long-lived AppleScript that asked Terminal for the frontmost
 tty every 250ms, forever — one Apple Event four times a second for the entire life of
 the app, whether or not Terminal was even open.

 `NSWorkspace` publishes app activation for free, so the expensive question is only
 asked when it can have changed:

 - the frontmost app changes → check once
 - a surface we can read is frontmost → poll slowly, because switching *tabs* raises no
   notification in either app
 - anything else is frontmost → do not poll at all

 A tab switch is the only case that needs polling, and a second of latency on an
 ambient indicator is imperceptible.

 VS Code was excluded from this for a long time, on the grounds that its windows do not
 say which chat is open and a guess is worse than nothing. That was true of AppleScript
 and is not true of the window title — so it is read here too, and a VS Code chat can
 finally be the one you are looking at.
