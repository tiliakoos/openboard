/**
 Find Claude Code sessions that are already running.

 The registry is rebuilt from hooks, and a hook only fires when a session *does*
 something. So after the app starts, a session sitting idle in another tab is invisible
 until you go and type in it — which is exactly backwards for a board whose job is to
 tell you what is happening without being asked.

 This walks the process table instead, so the board is populated the moment the app
 starts.

 ## Two signatures, and nothing else

 A terminal session is the bare `claude` command on a real tty: unambiguously `cli` and
 unambiguously interactive.

 An extension-hosted session has no tty at all, and for a long time that made it
 undiscoverable. The reasoning was that a tty-less `claude` might be the genuine VS Code
 extension — eligible — or an embedded SDK client, which is not: ten of those were once
 observed under an unrelated extension, and they would take all six keys before a human
 session appeared. `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_CLIENT_APP` tells them apart and is readable only by
 the process itself, so the hook path forwards it and this path cannot.

 But the *command line* says as much. A real VS Code chat runs Anthropic's binary out of
 the installed extension, driven over a stream-json pipe:

 ```
 ~/.vscode/extensions/anthropic.claude-code-<version>/resources/native-binary/claude \
   --output-format stream-json --verbose --input-format stream-json …
 ```

 An unrelated extension spawning `claude` runs its own copy or the one on `PATH`, not
 Anthropic's out of Anthropic's directory — so the path is the discriminator that was
 said not to exist. The flags are checked too, because the same binary in the same
 directory also runs as `--claude-in-chrome-mcp`, which is a server rather than a chat.

 Both halves must match, and either one changing means a session is not discovered —
 which is where this started, and is still fail-closed. It appears on its first hook.

     What cmux writes into every session it launches, and nothing else does.

     cmux does not run a bare `claude`. It passes `--session-id` and a whole `--settings`
     document that installs its own hooks, so the command line looks like this:

     ```
     /Users/x/.local/bin/claude --session-id 9f3… --settings {"hooks":{"Stop":[{…
       "command":"\"${CMUX_CLAUDE_HOOK_CMUX_BIN:-cmux}\" hooks claude stop"…
     ```

     Which the bare-CLI rule below refuses — correctly, by its own reasoning ("anything
     with flags on a tty is being driven by something else"), and wrongly in fact: a
     cmux tab is a human sitting in front of a terminal. The visible cost was that no
     cmux session was ever *discovered*. They appeared only once they emitted a hook, so
     every app restart filled the board with whatever older sessions `ps` happened to
     list first and left the ones actually being used off it.

     `CMUX_CLAUDE_HOOK_CMUX_BIN` is the discriminator, for the same reason the
     extension's *path* is the discriminator above: it is written by cmux, it names
     cmux's own binary, and no script or wrapper would have a reason to contain it. A
     general "any `claude` with `--session-id`" rule was deliberately not written — that
     would re-admit exactly the class this allowlist exists to keep out, and a new
     launcher can be added the day one is observed rather than guessed at.
