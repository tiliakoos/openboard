/**
 The coding agent whose sessions the board is showing.

 Everything this app knows about a harness is one of four things: **where its settings
 live**, **which events it emits**, **what those events mean**, and **which surfaces it
 runs on and how each one is reached**. Until now those four were scattered — the events
 in `HookInstall`, their meanings in `EventMapper`, the surfaces in `Eligibility` and
 `SessionOrigin`, the settings path in `HookInstall.settingsURL` — which was fine while
 there was exactly one agent and is the wrong shape the moment there are two.

 So this is the description, in one value. Adding a second harness means adding a
 `Harness` and teaching the mapper its event names; it does not mean finding four
 scattered places that assumed Claude Code.

 ## Three, and they are not equal

 Claude Code is wired end to end and OpenBoard writes its file. Hermes and Pi are wired
 as far as they can be: the same helper, the same socket, the same payload fields — but
 their configuration is theirs to edit, so the app hands over the exact text instead of
 writing YAML into somebody's file or dropping a TypeScript module into their extension
 directory.

 What a fourth would need, since the list no longer says so on screen: a way to run or
 call a command on session events, a per-session id stable for the life of the session,
 an event when a turn starts, ends and needs a human, and a local process — the board is
 driven over USB or Bluetooth from this Mac.

 Each also carries its `limitations`, and those are load-bearing rather than a
 disclaimer. Hermes has no completion event, so a Hermes key never turns green. Pi has
 no documented approval event, so a Pi key never turns orange — which is the state this
 whole board exists for. Saying that on the pane is the difference between a feature and
 a screen describing behaviour that does not exist.

     Claude Code's file is JSON that can be merged safely — every unrelated key and any
     other tool's hooks on the same events survive, and the previous version is backed
     up beside it. The others are not: Hermes keeps YAML, and Pi has no out-of-process
     hooks at all. Editing somebody's YAML by machine risks their comments and ordering,
     and there is no honest way to "install" into a mechanism that does not exist.

     So those two hand over the exact text instead. It is a worse experience and a true
     one, which is the trade this project keeps making.
