/**
 The wiring in `~/.claude/settings.json` that makes any of this happen.

 Without a hook entry per event the board simply never hears about a session. That
 failure is completely silent — the app runs, the pad connects, nothing ever lights —
 so this audits the wiring and names the specific event that is missing.

 ## Why this only ever reads, unless told otherwise

 `settings.json` affects *every* Claude Code session on the machine, not just this app.
 So `audit` is read-only and runs freely; `install` writes only when a person presses
 the button, and takes a timestamped backup first. Nothing here writes on launch.

 ## The failure this exists to catch

 A hook command is an absolute path to a binary inside the app bundle. Move, rename or
 reinstall the app and every hook still *looks* configured while silently failing —
 Claude Code does not report a hook that will not execute. `.stalePath` is that case,
 and it is the reason the audit checks the file exists rather than just comparing text.
