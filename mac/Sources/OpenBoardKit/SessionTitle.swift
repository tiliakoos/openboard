/**
 What to call a session.

 Six keys and six rows of "openboard" is not a board — if every row shows the working
 directory, the popover cannot tell you which chat is which, only which *project* is
 which. Two sessions in the same repo are indistinguishable, and that is the common
 case.

 The name used is Claude Code's own: an `ai-title` entry, which is the same string the
 VS Code extension renames its tab to. So a row in the popover and a tab in the editor
 read alike, and mapping a key to a chat is a matter of recognising the words rather
 than counting windows.

 An earlier version used the **first thing you asked for**, on the reasoning that
 Claude Code writes no title into a *live* transcript and `summary` lines only appear
 once a session is compacted. That is no longer true — `ai-title` is written from the
 first turn or two and rewritten as the session goes on — and the opening message was
 always a poor name for a session that has moved on. It stays as the fallback, because
 a chat too young to have been named still has to be told apart from five others.
 */

     A name, and whether it can be trusted not to change.

     The distinction is load-bearing. `ai-title` is *settled*: once Claude Code has
     named a session it rewrites the same line, so that answer can be kept forever and
     the popover — which asks on every repaint — never reads the file again.

     The opening message is only a **stand-in** until that name exists. Cached with the
     same finality it would freeze a row on the fallback seconds before the real name
     lands, and nothing would ever revisit it. So a provisional name is re-read, and
     only when the file has actually grown: a `stat` per repaint rather than a read.

/**
 Matching a session against the title of the window in front of you.

 VS Code has no way to say which chat is open, but its window title leads with the
 active tab's name and the Claude Code extension names its tabs after the session. So
 the title is the handle — the equivalent of Terminal's per-tab `tty`, and the only one
 on offer.

 It is not a clean handle. Observed, from a real title bar:

 ```
 Investigate VS Code even… — Projects
 ```

 VS Code **truncates** the tab name, around 25 characters, with a single-character
 ellipsis. A containment test against the session's full name therefore matches nothing,
 ever — which is exactly how this behaved for its first hour: the log showed VS Code
 focused and no slot matched, every time.

 So the comparison runs the other way. Take the leading segment, drop the ellipsis, and
 ask whether the session's name *starts with* what survived.

 Two sessions whose names agree for 25 characters are indistinguishable here. That is a
 real limit and an acceptable one: the alternative is no indicator at all, and the names
 are written to describe different work.
