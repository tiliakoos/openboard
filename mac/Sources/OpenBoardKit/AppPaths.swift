/**
 Where this app keeps things.

 Everything used to live in `~/.claude/openboard/` — the path the Node version wrote,
 chosen so an existing configuration was picked up unchanged. That was right while this
 was a personal tool sitting beside the Claude Code state it watches. It is wrong for
 something other people install:

 - **It is Anthropic's directory, not ours.** Putting user data in another vendor's
   config folder means it is not obviously yours to uninstall, and a reorganisation of
   `~/.claude/` could take a user's settings with it.
 - **One folder was doing four jobs** — preferences, hardware calibration, runtime
   state, logs, and an IPC socket — each of which macOS has a different convention for.

 So:

 | What | Where |
 |---|---|
 | `config.json`, `calibration.json`, `registry.json`, `hook.sock` | `~/Library/Application Support/OpenBoard/` |
 | `app.log` | `~/Library/Logs/OpenBoard/` |

 Logs are split out because `~/Library/Logs` is where Console.app looks and where "send
 me your logs" already points. Asking someone to open a dotfile directory to file a bug
 report is a worse first impression than it sounds.

 `OPENBOARD_HOME` still overrides everything, and still collapses both directories into
 one, so a test or a scratch run stays entirely self-contained.

 ## Not Application Support alone

 The socket lives here too rather than in a temp directory. A `sockaddr_un` path is
 limited to 104 bytes; this one is about 60, with room to spare, and a fixed location
 means the hook helper can find it without being told.

     Move an existing installation across, once.

     Only the files this app actually owns. The old directory also holds Node-era
     leftovers — `watch.log`, `keys.log`, `probe.jsonl` — and sweeping up things whose
     purpose is not understood is how a migration destroys something.

     Moves rather than copies. Two copies of a settings file is the worse failure: you
     edit one, the app reads the other, and nothing you change appears to take. The old
     directory itself is left in place, because it is Claude Code's and may hold state
     that is none of our business.

     Idempotent by construction — a file already at the destination is never
     overwritten, so this is safe to call on every launch, and safe if it half-finished
     last time.
