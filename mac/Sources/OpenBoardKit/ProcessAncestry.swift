/**
 Which application a terminal session is actually running inside.

 A tty is not enough to tell. VS Code's integrated terminal allocates a real pty just
 as Terminal.app does, so a session there looks identical from the outside: entrypoint
 `cli`, a `/dev/ttysNNN`, a zsh, a `claude`. `SessionOrigin` said "Terminal" for both,
 and its own doc comment admitted the entrypoint could not distinguish them — then
 labelled it Terminal anyway.

 That mislabelling had a visible cost. Pressing the key tried to select a Terminal tab
 by tty, found none (Terminal does not own that pty), and fell through to opening the
 session's *folder* in VS Code — so "jump to this chat" opened an editor on a
 directory.

 The parent chain answers it exactly: walk up from the shell and see whose process it
 is. `ps` is not free, so callers should ask once and store the answer rather than
 asking per repaint.

     `ps` for one process: its parent and its executable path.

     ## Why this does not call `waitUntilExit`

     `Process.waitUntilExit()` on the main thread **runs the main run loop** while it
     waits. This is called from inside `SessionRegistry.reconnect`, which is a mutating
     method on a stored property — so the run loop drained a queued `paint()`, `paint()`
     took a second mutating access to the same registry, and Swift's exclusivity
     checking aborted the process. The app died at launch, intermittently, depending on
     whether a repaint happened to be queued.

     A semaphore signalled from the termination handler waits just as thoroughly and
     runs nothing while it does. The handler fires on a background queue, so blocking
     the main thread here cannot deadlock against it.

     The wait is nearly instant regardless: `readDataToEndOfFile` above has already
     blocked until `ps` closed its output. The timeout only exists so that a `ps` that
     somehow never exits costs a stale reading instead of a frozen board.
