/**
 Why the pad is not there.

 "No Codex Micro found" is true in several very different situations, and the remedy
 differs completely: press a key, turn Bluetooth on, pair it, or grant a permission.
 A single message that covers all of them tells the user nothing they can act on.

 This matters more for this device than most. It attaches over Bluetooth LE, where
 **disconnecting is normal rather than exceptional** — the pad idles out, and to macOS
 it simply stops existing as a HID device. Reporting that as "not found" reads as
 broken hardware when the answer is to touch a key.
