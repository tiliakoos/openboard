/**
 Whether a session is mid-turn, asked rather than assumed.

 On restart the board has to decide what a session that was `working` is doing *now*.
 It used to settle it to `idle`, on the reasoning that "nothing was happening while the
 app was closed". That is true of the app and false of the session: Claude Code is a
 separate process that kept going the whole time, and the app is only a light. Any
 session mid-turn during a relaunch came back saying nothing was happening.

 Both obvious fixes are guesses. Keeping `working` is wrong for a turn that finished
 while the app was down; settling to `idle` is wrong for one that did not. So neither
 is used — the transcript is read instead, because it says which it was.

 ## What the transcript shows

 Claude Code appends to `<session>.jsonl` as it goes, and the last conversational entry
 places you in the turn:

 - **`user`** → the assistant owes a reply. Either a human just typed, or a tool result
   just came back mid-turn. Working.
 - **`assistant` with `stop_reason: "tool_use"`** → it asked for a tool and is waiting
   on the answer. Still working.
 - **`assistant` with any other stop reason** — `end_turn`, `stop_sequence` — → the
   turn is finished and nothing is owed.

 ## Why the role alone is not enough

 The first version of this read only the role, on the reasoning that tool use
 alternates `assistant` then `user`, so an in-progress turn always ends on `user`. It
 does not: between asking for a tool and the result arriving — which is most of a long
 turn's wall-clock — the file ends on `assistant`.

 That was caught by checking against this machine's live transcript rather than the
 fixtures, which agreed with the wrong rule because I wrote both. Of 3,103 assistant
 entries in one session, 2,981 carry `tool_use`: the case the rule got wrong was the
 overwhelmingly common one.

 ## Read from the end

 A transcript runs to megabytes over a long session. Only the tail is needed, so only
 the tail is read — the file is seeked to its last few KB rather than parsed forward.
