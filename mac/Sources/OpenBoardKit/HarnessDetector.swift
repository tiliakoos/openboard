/**
 Which coding harnesses are actually on this Mac.

 The sidebar used to show Claude Code as connected whether or not it was there,
 because "connected" meant "OpenBoard supports this" rather than "this exists". Those
 are different claims and only one of them is checkable.

 ## Every row is a probe that ran

 A harness appears here only if there is something specific to look for: a config
 directory it creates on first run, an app bundle, a binary on the path. A row we cannot
 probe would sit permanently grey, which reads as *absent* while meaning *unknown* —
 the same class of lie as a red dot for a sleeping pad.

 That is why this is three rather than the fifty-nine CodexBar draws icons for: a
 harness earns a row by being one OpenBoard can drive, and everything else was a list
 of things it cannot.

 ## Cheap enough to run on appearance

 Every probe is a `stat` or two. No subprocesses, no `which`, nothing that shells out —
 the pane calls this when it opens and the cost is invisible. `PATH` is searched
 directly rather than by running a shell, because spawning one per harness to answer a
 question about the filesystem is how a settings pane starts taking a second to open.
