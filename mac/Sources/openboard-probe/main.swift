 A diagnostic, and the only way to exercise the IOKit layer against real hardware
 without launching the menu bar app.

 Equivalent to `openboard devices` in the Node version, and it exists for the same
 reason: when the pad does not light there are four completely different causes —
 not plugged in, wrong interface, no permission, no calibration — and they are
 indistinguishable from the outside.

 Run from a terminal that already holds Input Monitoring:
   swift run openboard-probe            survey and open
   swift run openboard-probe --paint    also light slot 1 orange for 2s
