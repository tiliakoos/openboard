/**
 Auditing the hook wiring.

 A missing or dead hook is the most silent failure in the whole system: the app runs,
 the pad connects, and nothing ever lights, because Claude Code does not report a hook
 that fails to execute.

 The write path gets the most scrutiny here — `settings.json` belongs to every session
 on the machine, not to this app.

     command was `…/debug/Contents/MacOS/openboard-hook` — a path that has never
