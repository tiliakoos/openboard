# Watch a real update happen, without publishing anything.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# The update path cannot be exercised by shipping. The first release is what people
# install, so nothing updates until the *second* — which means the first time the
# download/verify/swap/relaunch sequence runs for real is on a version that is already
# in front of users. That is a bad place to discover that the framework was embedded
# wrong or the signature does not verify.
#
# So: two throwaway builds, a feed on localhost, and an install that updates itself
# while you watch. Nothing is tagged, nothing is notarized, nothing reaches the real
# appcast.
#
# ## What it actually proves
#
# The parts that are silent when broken: that Sparkle can parse the feed, that the
# EdDSA signature verifies against the key compiled into the app, that the bundle can
# be replaced in place, and that the app comes back afterwards. It does *not* prove
# notarization or Gatekeeper — those need a Developer ID build and a real download,
# and tools/release.sh covers them.
#
# ## The version numbers
#
# Deliberately absurd: 9.9.8 and 9.9.9, far above anything real. Sparkle compares
# CFBundleVersion, so a test build has to out-rank the genuine one to be offered — and
# if one of these ever escapes onto a machine, an absurd number is the loudest possible
# clue about where it came from.
#
# Usage: mac/tools/test-update.sh [--port 8765]

Now: Settings → Device → Version → Check now.

Expected, in order:

  1. "Version $NEW_VERSION is available" appears in the menu bar popover, above
     Find running sessions.
  2. Sparkle offers the update, showing the release notes from the feed.
  3. It downloads, verifies the signature, replaces the bundle, and relaunches.
  4. The Version section then reads $NEW_VERSION.

If step 3 fails, the reason is in the log rather than the dialog:

  grep -i "update\|sparkle" ~/Library/Logs/OpenBoard/app.log

The most likely failure is a signature mismatch, which means the key in
build-app.sh is not the one in your keychain — and that is worth knowing now
rather than on the first real release.

Leave this running while you test. Ctrl-C stops the server.
