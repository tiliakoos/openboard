# Cut a distributable OpenBoard release: universal build, Developer ID signature,
# notarization, stapling, and a Sparkle-signed zip ready to attach to a GitHub release.
#
# ## Why each step is here
#
# A Mac app downloaded from the internet carries a quarantine flag. Gatekeeper checks
# it against Apple's notary service, and an app that has not been through notarization
# is refused with "Apple could not verify OpenBoard is free of malware" — a dialog with
# no obvious way past it. Notarization is what turns that into a normal first launch.
#
# Stapling matters separately: without it Gatekeeper has to *reach Apple* on first
# launch to learn the app is notarized. On a machine that is offline, or behind a
# captive portal, that check fails closed. Stapling attaches the ticket to the bundle
# so the answer travels with it.
#
# The zip is made with `ditto`, not `zip`. `zip` does not preserve symlinks or extended
# attributes inside a bundle, which breaks the signature — the failure surfaces much
# later as a notarization rejection that names nothing useful.
#
# Usage: mac/tools/release.sh [--skip-notarize]
#
# Environment:
#   OB_IDENTITY         Developer ID Application identity (default: first one found)
#   OB_NOTARY_PROFILE   notarytool keychain profile (default: openboard-notary)
#   OB_SPARKLE_BIN      directory holding Sparkle's sign_update (default: search)
#
# One-time setup for notarization:
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials openboard-notary \
#     --apple-id you@example.com --team-id TEAMID --password <app-specific-password>

# Every one of these fails much later and much less clearly if left to be discovered:
