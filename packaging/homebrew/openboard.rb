# Homebrew cask for OpenBoard.
#
# This file is the source of truth; the copy Homebrew reads lives in the tap repo at
#   github.com/camwilso/homebrew-tap  →  Casks/openboard.rb
# Copy it across when cutting a release, or let the release workflow do it.
#
# Why a personal tap rather than homebrew-cask proper: the main repo requires a
# notability threshold (roughly 75 stars / 30 forks / 30 watchers) before it will take
# a cask. A tap works from the first release and the install line is barely longer.
#
#   brew install --cask camwilso/tap/openboard

  caveats <<~EOS
    Open OpenBoard and it will walk you through setup — permissions, key order,
    and the Claude Code hooks. It has no Dock icon; it lives in the menu bar.

    Two things it cannot do for you, both on the pad itself:
      · pair the Codex Micro with this Mac, over Bluetooth or USB
      · keep it on Layer 1 — per-key status renders only there

    Hooks are read when a Claude Code session starts, so open a new one to see
    the keys light. Sessions already running will not report until they restart.

    Before uninstalling, turn the hooks off in Settings → Device. Deleting the app
    without doing that leaves eight entries in ~/.claude/settings.json pointing at
    a binary that is gone, and every session will try to run it on every event.
